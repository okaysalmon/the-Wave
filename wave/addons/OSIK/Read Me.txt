OSIK – Okay Salmon Inverse Kinematics

OSIK (Okay Salmon Inverse Kinematics) is a custom Godot 4.5+ node designed to make inverse kinematics simple, lightweight, and fun to use. This tool is completely free to use, modify, and include in your own projects.

🧩 Installation

Copy the entire OSIK folder into your Godot 4.5 (or later) project. Edit: I’ve updated it to follow the standard addon setup. Place the OSIK folder in res://addons/OSIK. If you’re unsure, check the file locations in the demo.

When adding a new node, you’ll see OSIK in the node list, select it just like any other node.

⚙️ Setup & Usage

The OSIK Node must be a child of the Skeleton3D node you wish to modify.

The Target can be any node in your scene, it doesn’t have to be a child of the skeleton or OSIK node.

If you make changes to the OSIK script, set the Active property to Off before editing to prevent errors.

🧠 Notes

This is a work-in-progress tool, so feel free to experiment, expand, and improve upon it.
